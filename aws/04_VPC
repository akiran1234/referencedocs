# VPC refers to Virtual Private Cloud which will create  virtual  isolated network in the cloud.
# Below is the equal subnet caliculator from the given CIDR block.
# https://www.site24x7.com/tools/ipv4-subnetcalculator.html
# By default a route table is created for every VPC called main route table by which all the subnets in vpc can talk to each other.
# By default Network ACL is also created for every VPC.
# In general when a subnet is created 1 ip is reserved for subnet id and 1 ip is reserved for broadcast id.
# For every VPC subnet's 5 ips will be reserved by aws (First 4 and last 1 ip's are reserved)
# subnet's are associated with route tables.
# A subnet can be  associated with only one route table however one route table can be associated with many subnet's.
# route table will identify to which subnet the traffic has to be routed.
# Internet Gateway: which will talk to outside internet world and there will be one Internet Gateway per VPC.
# NAT Gateway: which is associated with public subnet will facilitate the private network to send the outbound traffic to outside world.
# How public subnet will talk to outside world
# First public subnet has to be associated with route table and this route table should be associated with Internet Gateway.
# pub_subnet --> pub_route_table  --> Internet Gateway
# priv_subnet-->  priv_route_table -->  Nat Gateway --> Public Subnet --> (pub_subnet --> route_table --> Internet Gateway)

# NACL (Network Access Control List)
# NACL will give the security in the subnet level. Security Group will enable the firewall in the instance Level
# Let say we want to enable for a subnet only http and https that can be done from NACL.
