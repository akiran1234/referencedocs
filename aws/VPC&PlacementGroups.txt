# VPC refers to Virtual Private Cloud which will create  virtual  isolated network in the cloud.

# https://www.site24x7.com/tools/ipv4-subnetcalculator.html

# By default a route table is created for every VPC called main route table by which all the subnets in vpc can talk to each other.
# By default Network ACL is also created for every VPC.
# In general when a subnet is created 1 ip is reserved for subnet id and 1 ip is reserved for broadcast id.
# For every VPC subnet's 5 ips will be reserved by aws (First 4 and last 1 ip's are reserved)
# subnet's are associated with route tables.
# A subnet can be  associated with only one route table however one route table can be associated with many subnet's.
# route table will identify to which subnet the traffic has to be routed.
# Internet Gateway: which will talk to outside internet world and there will be one Internet Gateway per VPC.
# NAT Gateway: which is associated with public subnet will facilitate the private network to send the outbound traffic to outside world.
# How public subnet will talk to outside world
# First public subnet has to be associated with route table and this route table should be associated with Internet Gateway.
# pub_subnet --> pub_route_table  --> Internet Gateway
# priv_subnet-->  priv_route_table -->  Nat Gateway --> Public Subnet --> (pub_subnet --> route_table --> Internet Gateway)

########################################## Placement Groups ######################################################################
1. Logically grouping the instances with in a single Availability Zone is Placement Group.
2. The main purpose of Placement group is for applications which require Low Latency (10Gbps Network) and high Network throughput.
3. Ex: Hadoop Clusters and No-SQL Db's require low latency and high throughput Networks for better performance.
4. Placement Group cannot span across multiple AZ's.
5. Placement Group will have homogenous instances which is recommended by AWS.
6. Instance Types can be (Compute Optimised, GPU, Memory Optimised, Storage Optimised)
7. Placement Groups cannot be merged and a new instance cannot be added to Placement Group.
8. Latency: is referred to elapsed time taken to perform an action.
9. Through Put: refers to how many no of actions completed per unit of time (No of actions per hour/day/week). That is the reason good networks will have high throughput.

########################################## Elastic Bean Stack ######################################################################
1. Elastic Bean Stack is a PAAS (Platform As a Service) for developers.
2. Developers need not worry about Infrastructure Provision by using Elastic Bean Stack. 
3. Code and upload the artifacts to Bean Stack it will automatically provision the required Infrastructure resources.
4. It will support applications like Java, .Net, Php, Python, Ruby and Docker containers.
5.
