Jenkins is developed on java and can  be downloaded as war file.
Jenkins has servelet container Jetty/winstone and run own it's own with out the need of other servelet container like tomcat.
How ever jenkins war file can be deployed to tomcat and run along with all the applications.
/var/lib/jenkins              --> Jenkins Home Directory
/var/lib/jenkins              --> Configuration files.
/var/lib/jenkins/config.xml   --> Jenkins Home Directory, Work Space Directory ,Job Build Directory and password recovery property.
/var/lib/jenkins/users        --> Will have all the jenkin users created.
/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log  --> View the log of jenkins
/etc/default/jenkins;         --> Jenkins Home Dir(default-/var/lib/jenkins), JENKINS_PORT (Default-8080) can be modified from this file.
************************************************************************************************************************************
1. what is custom work space- While desigining the job we can change the default work space dir to custome workspace.
    general tab-->advanced--> Use Custom workspace
2. What  jenkins home dir have?
    workspace # Each jenkin job creates it's own directory with job name where war/ear will be created.
    users     # Under users dir, each user has one dirctory.
    plugins   # will have all the plugin

3. what config.xml file will have?
    Details like WorkSpace Directory, Job Build Directory for every job  and password recovery property.
4. How to execute jenkins from command line.
    java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ create-job NAME # This will create new job
    java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ shutdown        # This will shutdown jenkins server

4 Jenkins Password Recovery
1.Method
Best Practice by generating jbcrypt password: http://bcrypthashgenerator.apphb.com/
edit --> /var/lib/jenkins/users/admin/config.xml
go to the below tag and remove the jbcrypt password and generate new jbcrypt and replace 
<passwordHash>#jbcrypt:$2a$10$f/2gW3vK6G4.7eWJgvXpm.MKcuSpbYKH3F121QsvJFJUv9Ap9KdZe</passwordHash>
then restart jenkins server sudo service jenkins restart
2.Method 
edit /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml
<useSecurity>true</useSecurity>  --> change from true to false and restart jenkins server.
login the jenkins ui by giving username as admin and leave password blank.
set the password for admin and change the <useSecurity>false</useSecurity>  --> change from false to true and restart jenkins server.


-----------------Auto SSH by generating RSA Key--------------
ssh-keygen -t rsa -- executing this command it will generate both public (id_rsa.pub) and private key (id_rsa) in the selected folder. This keys has to be generated from the local machine.
copy the public key which is generated in local machine to remote machine  authorised keys file	-->	         /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys
now from local machine we can connect remote by this command
ssh ec2-user@ip-address # ec2-user is the remote machine user id.
********************************Jenkins Interview Questions******************************
You can use any one of the following commands to start Jenkins manually:
http://localhost:8080/exit − shutdown jenkins
http://localhost:8080/restart − restart jenkins
http://localhost:8080/reload − to reload the configuration
http://localhost:8080/safeRestart- Allows all running builds to complete.

To start Jenkins manually open Console/Command line, then go to your Jenkins installation directory. Over there you can use the below commands:
To start Jenkins: jenkins.exe start
To stop Jenkins: jenkins.exe stop
To restart Jenkins: jenkins.exe restart
