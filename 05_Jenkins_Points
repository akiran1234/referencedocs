edit --> /var/lib/jenkins/users/admin/config.xml
go to the below tag and remove the jbcrypt password and generate new jbcrypt and replace 
<passwordHash>#jbcrypt:$2a$10$f/2gW3vK6G4.7eWJgvXpm.MKcuSpbYKH3F121QsvJFJUv9Ap9KdZe</passwordHash>
then restart jenkins server sudo service jenkins restart
2.Method 
edit /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml
<useSecurity>true</useSecurity>  --> change from true to false and restart jenkins server.
login the jenkins ui by giving username as admin and leave password blank.
set the password for admin and change the <useSecurity>false</useSecurity>  --> change from false to true and restart jenkins server.

ssh-keygen -t rsa -- executing this command it will generate both public (id_rsa.pub) and private key (id_rsa) in the selected folder. This keys has to be generated from the local machine.
copy the public key which is generated in local machine to remote machine  authorised keys file	-->	         /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys
now from local machine we can connect remote by this command
ssh ec2-user@ip-address # ec2-user is the remote machine user id.
