# A variable is a location with address in memory used to store some value (data)
# In python we "don't need" to declare a variable before using it.
# One Important feature in python is no need of declaring a data type, interpreter will dynamically identify and assigns its datatype
# In python declaring only variable is not allowed, it has to be declared and assigned with value as shown below.
# Each data type is a class in Python and the declared variable is an object which corresponds to it's class.

# age           # I have declared age variable with out assigning a value which is not valid.
age=30          # Number Variable  - An integer object with value 30 is created for int class.
price=45.456    # Float Variable   - An float object with value 45.456  is created for float class.
name="Python"   # String Variable  - An string object with value "Python" is created for str class (String class).
val=345j        # Complex Variable - An complex object with value 345j is created for complex class.


# Python handles implicit datatype conversion.
a=50            # Now python defines 'a' as int datatype.
a=a+897.457     # Now python implicitly converts 'a' to float datatype.


# In interactive python shell, we can print the values of variables by typing variable name at prompt but in the script level it should be with print statement
print("Printing age, price and name values:",age,price,name)  # Printing the values of assigned variables in script level using print statement


# Assigning  of variables in Python in different ways.
# Single Assignment
x=10            # An integer object 'x' of type 'int class' with value 10
print("Printing x value",x)

# Multiple Assignment
y=z=k=20        # y,z,k this three integer objects are referenced with same address location value=20
print("Printing y,z,k with same reference value",y,z,k)

a, b, c = 10, "Linux", 100.55678
print("Printing a,b,c values:",a,b,c)

# Swamping of variables

x1=100; y1=200
print("Printing x1,y1 values:",x1,y1,'\n')
x1,y1=y1,x1
print("Printing x1,y1 values:",x1,y1,'\n')

# "del" variable is used to delete the assigned values of variables.The variables should be from it's current tracking session.

var1=var2=var3=10
del var1,var2         # Here var1 is deleted but not the assigned  value.
# print(var1)         # if we try to print var1 we get error -name var1 not defined

# Data types in Python
# Mutable means changeable and immutable means not changeable
# Sequence is the generic term for an ordered set of values.
# len(),min(),max() are builtin functions which belongs to builtin module and can be applied on sequence datatype objects.

# 1. Numeric data types     # int, long(deprecated), float, complex
# 2. String Data type       # Immutable sequence data type, stores sequence of characters.
# 3. List Data type  []     # Mutable   sequence data type, where we can update,delete,remove the values of list object.
# 4. Tuple Data type ()     # Immutable sequence data type, where we cannot update delete and remove the values of tuple object.
# 5. Set Data type   {}     # A set is an unordered collection i.e no indexing and  with no duplicate elements.
# 6. Dictionary Data type   # Which holds key value data elements.

# 2. String Data types (Immutable)

# Strings in Python are identified as a continuous  set of characters represented in quotation marks.
# Python allows for either pairs of single or double quotes.
# Subsets of strings can be accessed  using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) and indexing.
# Index of the string starts with 0 hence ends with length of string-1 (n-1). Accessing from end of the string starts with -1,-2 and so on.
# The plus (+) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator.
# Updating & Deleting  the string object is valid but updating & deleting the string indexing characters in in valid.

# String operators
# Most of the below operators are in common and applicable to data sequence objects (string,list,tuple) to retrieve the data.

# +       --> Concatenation operator, which will concat two or more string objects.
# *       --> Repetition operator,    which will create new string by concatenating multiple copies of the same string.
# []      --> Slice operator,         Will give the character from the given index.
# [:]     --> Range Slice operator,   will give the character's from the given range.
# in      --> Membership operator,    Returns true if character exists in the given string.
# not in  --> Membership operator,    Returns true if character doesn't exists in the given string.
# % or {} --> Format specifier,       in old version using % and new version using {}.
